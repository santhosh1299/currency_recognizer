# Currency Recognizer Project

The Currency Recognizer Project is a revolutionary application aimed at assisting individuals with visual impairments by leveraging cutting-edge technology to identify currency denominations from images. Utilizing the VGG16 model, the project predicts the denomination of various currencies and provides the local currency value, empowering users in financial transactions.

## Project Workflow

1. **Image Capture**: Users capture currency images using the intuitive Android application.
   
2. **Image Transmission**: Captured images are seamlessly transmitted to the Flask server for processing.
   
3. **Currency Prediction**: The Flask server employs the VGG16 model to predict currency denominations accurately.
   
4. **Local Currency Value Calculation**: Post-prediction, the system calculates the local currency value, offering users comprehensive financial information.

## Technologies Utilized
